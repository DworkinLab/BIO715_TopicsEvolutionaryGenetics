# BIO715_TopicsEvolutionaryGenetics

Course Page for BIO715 (2025) taught by Brian Golding and Ian Dworkin (and maybe Ben Evans will join in for some fun)

When: Monday 2:30 - 4:30 fall semester (2025). First class will be September 8th, 2025.

Where: LSB 213A (the seminar room in LSB inside the lounge on the 2nd floor).

Instuctors: Dr. Brian Golding, Dr. Ian Dworkin and when he can find some spare time from his job as chair of the department, Dr. Ben Evans.

## What is this course is about: 

Topics broadly spanning "Evolutionary Genetics". See course content below.

## Expected Background:
We generally expect you to have an introductory Genetics (equivalent of BIO2C03) and introductory evolutionary biology (equivalent of BIO3FF3), we do not expect any specific knowledge of population genetics (equivalent of BIO3PG3) or Molecular Evolution (equivalent of MolBiol4DD3), but of course they will help! We will be providing both review readings as well as the primary literature readings to help everyone get up to speed. We also (below) will have some background resources if you feel they will help.

## Course content
For the first 6-7 weeks, we will discussing several topics in *phenotypic evolution*, largely from a quantitative genetics perspective. In particular we will focus on concepts of *evolvability* (the propensity for a trait to evolve), *evolutionary rates* (how fast do traits evolve) and the *predictiability of evolutionary response*, in particular how well does mutational and genetic variation *within* species provide a prediction of divergence among species? We will cap this section of the course off with a discussion about the (dis)cordance between molecular and phenotypic rates of evolution (although we may save this for the very last week).

For the second half of the course (the remaining 6 weeks), we will focus more on *molecular evolution* and *molecular population genetics*. Among the topics we might look at include the phenomena of lateral gene transfer,  low complexity sequence evolution, repetitive element evolution, sex chromosome evolution (for Prof. Evans), the evolution of new genes, and other topics to be determined.


## How will we grade this class.

Each week there will be a written critique of a specific paper (details to follow, but ~ 1 page in length). You are expected to attend all classes as class discussions will be another major part of the assessment. Finally, each student will be expected to write an independent, synthetic and analytical paper based on topics you will choose (but approved by Ben, Brian or Ian). 


## Primary readings

You should have access to all of these via McMaster library. If you have any problems reach out to Ian or Brian (depending on who is leading class)., as we have PDFs of all of them.

### Week of September 8th

#### Refresher readings for September 8th
Refresh yourself (or introduce yourself) to the fundamentals of Quantitative Genetics. While the first two papers below do an admirable job, some may find a more introductory chapter or two helpful to read first. The perfect readings for this would be chapters 4-6 of [Conner, J & Hartl, D. 2004. **A primer of ecological genetics**](https://mcmaster.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_MU/deno1h/alma991002998479707371). This book puts everything in a very evolutionary, which will be very useful. Unfortunately our library does not seem to have an electronic copy of it, (there is one physical copy in the library). Alternatively chapters 8 & 9 of [Hartl, D. 2020. **A primer of population genetics and genomics**](https://mcmaster.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_MU/deno1h/alma991015862049707371) are a reasonable introduction to quantitative genetics.


However, the relevant chapter in amost any Genetics of Evolutionary Biology textbook will do just fine. It may be called "Quantitative Genetics" or "Genetics of complex traits" or something like that. I recommend reading one of these first before reading the papers below. Come prepared with lots of questions about what you don't understand about Quantitative Genetics. I will spend much of the first week helping to get everyone up to speed.
