# BIO715_TopicsEvolutionaryGenetics

Course Page for BIO715 (2025) taught by Brian Golding and Ian Dworkin (and maybe Ben Evans will join in for some fun)

When: Monday 2:30 - 4:30 fall semester (2025). First class will be September 8th, 2025.

Where: LSB 213A (the seminar room in LSB inside the lounge on the 2nd floor).

Instuctors: Dr. Brian Golding, Dr. Ian Dworkin and when he can find some spare time from his job as chair of the department, Dr. Ben Evans.

## What is this course is about: 

This course will provide an introduction and/or refresher for graduate students interested in topics broadly spanning "Evolutionary Genetics". 

## Expected Background:
We generally expect you to have an introductory Genetics (equivalent of BIO2C03) and introductory evolutionary biology (equivalent of BIO3FF3), we do not expect any specific knowledge of population genetics (equivalent of BIO3PG3) or Molecular Evolution (equivalent of MolBiol4DD3), but of course they will help! We will be providing both review readings as well as the primary literature readings to help everyone get up to speed. We also (below) will have some background resources if you feel they will help.

## Course content
For the first 6-7 weeks, we will discussing several topics in *phenotypic evolution*, largely from a quantitative genetics perspective. In particular we will focus on concepts of *evolvability* (the propensity for a trait to evolve), *evolutionary rates* (how fast do traits evolve) and the *predictiability of evolutionary response*, in particular how well does mutational and genetic variation *within* species provide a prediction of divergence among species? We will cap this section of the course off with a discussion about the (dis)cordance between molecular and phenotypic rates of evolution (although we may save this for the very last week).

For the second half of the course (the remaining 6 weeks), we will focus more on *molecular evolution* and *molecular population genetics*. Specifically.... (Brian please add what you want)


## How will we grade this class.

Each week there will be a written critique of a specific paper (details to follow, but ~ 1 page in length). You are expected to attend all classes as class discussions will be another major part of the assessment. Finally, each student will be expected to write an independent, synthetic and analytical paper based on topics you will choose (but approved by Ben, Brian or Ian). 


## Primary readings

You should have access to all of these via McMaster library. If you have any problems reach out to Ian, as he had PDFs of all of them.
